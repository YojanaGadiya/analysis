=========

- `Citation analysis <https://github.com/hememap/analysis/blob/master/notebooks/citation_analysis.ipynb>`_. Analysis of the research publications included in HemeMap.
- `Graph summary <https://github.com/hememap/analysis/blob/master/notebooks/graph_summary.ipynb>`_. Summary of HemeMap.
- `HemeMap DataFrame <https://github.com/hememap/analysis/blob/master/notebooks/hememap_dataframe.ipynb>`_. Summary of individual review papers and research articles comprising HemeMap.
- `Paths with key players <https://github.com/hememap/analysis/blob/master/notebooks/paths_with_key_players.ipynb>`_. Analysis of key players that are involved in HemeMap and pathway databases (KEGG, Reactome and WikiPathways converted into BEL using PathMe python package).
- `Pathways Overlap <https://github.com/hememap/analysis/blob/master/notebooks/pathways_overlap.ipynb>`_. Evaluates the degree of overlap between the KEGG, Reactome and WikiPathways network across the HemeMap and visualization of the overlap.

- `Relationships between nodes in the HemeMap <https://github.com/hememap/analysis/blob/master/notebooks/relationships_between_nodes.ipynb>`_. Calculates the relations between nodes (from source node to target node) in a path extracted from HemeMap.
- `Terminology <https://github.com/hememap/analysis/blob/master/notebooks/terminology.ipynb>`_. Calculates the histogram representing the terminology statistics captured from textual knowledge explaining the abundances, biological processes and pathologies specific to heme related events.
- `Visualize HemeMap <https://github.com/hememap/analysis/blob/master/notebooks/visualize_hememap.ipynb>`_. Merges all the BEL files contained in the curation folder curated from the selected corpora and visualization of the corresponding network.
